The Context:

Why is this problem important to solve?

This problem is important to solve because the used car market in India is witnessing significant growth, with demand shifting from new cars to pre-owned vehicles. Accurate pricing of used cars is crucial for both buyers and sellers, ensuring a fair market value and fostering trust between parties. By developing a pricing model that effectively predicts the prices of used cars, Cars4U can capitalize on this market trend, facilitating profitable transactions and gaining a competitive advantage in the industry.

The objective:

What is the intended goal?

The intended goal is to develop a pricing model that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on various factors, such as mileage, brand, model, year, and more. This model will enable Cars4U to devise profitable strategies using differential pricing, ultimately helping the business grow in the rapidly expanding pre-owned car market.

The key questions:

What are the key questions that need to be answered?
Which factors have the most significant impact on the pricing of used cars in the Indian market? How can Cars4U leverage the predictive pricing model to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction? How can the model be refined and validated to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy?

The problem formulation:

What is it that we are trying to solve using data science?
Using data science, we aim to analyze the dataset containing various attributes related to used cars and identify patterns and relationships between these attributes and their prices. By building a robust predictive model, we can provide Cars4U with insights to optimize their pricing strategy, meeting customer expectations, and capturing market opportunities.
